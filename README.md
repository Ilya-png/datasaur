### Notes

* It's a usual fork it, clone it, run `jest --watch-all` type of exercise.
* You'll practice your `map`, `filter` using helper functions!
* You'll also some object practice.
* And some of that object work might look familiar, as we've covered the same problems before. If you can, don't look at the old solutions and come up with new versions with the knowledge and techniques you've gained in the meantime!
