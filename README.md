### Notes

* It's a usual fork it, clone it, run `jest --watch-all` type of exercise.
* You'll practice your `map`, `filter` using helper functions!
* You'll also some object practice.
* And some of that object work might look familiar, as we've covered the same problems before. If you can, don't look at the old solutions and come up with new versions with the knowledge and techniques you've gained in the meantime!


### Issues

There are some helper functions that do NOT have tests for them (a helper function for `notExtinct` and a helper function for `herbivoresOnly`). At that point, you should be used to doing the helper functions and have a rhythm going, so this shouldn't be a problem. But let us know if writing these functions without guardrails is what's tripping you up!
